		Overstock has had a long history that they want to tell the world about. That is why they’ve created a clever interactive timeline <br>that summarizes all the milestones the company has experienced in their About Us page. For instance when the company was rated <br>#4 in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for Customer Satisfaction in 2004, or when they became the first major company to <br>accept bitcoin as a form of payment in 2014, or in 2018 when they introduced augmented reality to their shopping app for <br>Android users using Google’s ARCore technology. Overstock feels that their visitors want to consume this information and uses their About Us page for that.
